CUNY-IT-Presentation
====================

## Life With Pi: Microcomputing in Academia
This shared repo is used to collaboratively prepare a presentation with interactive demonstrations at the [CUNY 12th Annual IT Conference](http://cunyitconference.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) on Friday, December 6, 2013.

## Abstract

The Raspberry Pi and Arduino&mdash;inexpensive and versatile credit-card-sized computers&mdash;have been embraced by the open-source and DIY communities. This presentation will describe and illustrate how these powerful microcomputers are now finding an expanding range of applications in academic and library settings.
 
Microcomputers consist of little more than a miniature processor (similar to those found in smart phones), memory, and a number of inputs and outputs. Yet they offer significant potential for use in facilitating IT education (for novice programmers, modelers, etc.) and in operating tools such as dynamic displays, experimental monitors, and library catalog search stations. 
 
The size, affordability, and versatility of microcomputers make it easy to develop, deploy, and replicate projects. This presentation will introduce microcomputing technologies, describe the communities of practice that use them, and demonstrate original, interactive applications for research and instruction.
